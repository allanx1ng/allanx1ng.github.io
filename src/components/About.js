              My name is Allan Xing and I{"'"}m currently in my second year of
              studying computer science at UBC. I have programmed in various
              languages such as Java, Javascript and Python, through personal
              projects such as full-stack web development, smart contrat
              development and game development. In addition to personal
              projects, I am experienced in object-oriented design, data
              structures and algorithms.
